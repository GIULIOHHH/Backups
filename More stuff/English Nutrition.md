# Nutrition Intro
A nutrient is a substance (found in food) needed for the body to function properly (and develop). 
There are many types of nutrients, and they can be classified into 6 major groups 
>Theres also fiber 
1. Water
2. Carbohidrates. "go foods"
3. Fats. "concetrated go foods"
4. proteins "grow foods"
5. vitamins "glow foods"
6. minerals "glow foods"

*Go foods* give energy, *grow foods* enhance growth, and *glow foods* enhance the quality (or glow) of our skin, because theyre rich in vitamin D.
>Nutrients also control body functions.
# Carbs
Compounds that consists of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
Theyre produced in photosynthesys.
Theyre digested by the liver by breaking them down into simple sugars, stimulating insulin production.
Theres 2 types of carbs:
1. Simple / monosaccharides
	1. More easily digested.
	2. The major kind of simple sugar is glucose 
		1. the basic source of energy for all living things
		2. Provides quick energy 
		3. found in some fruits and vegetables and processed foods
		4. Produced by breaking down other foods
	3. Make insulin levels increase faster 
2. Complex / polysaccharides.
	1. Made up of sugar molecules strung in long complex chains.
	2. Supply energy, other nutrients and fiber 
	3. Take longer to digest
		1. Fill you up more 
		2. give longer lasting energy 
	4. Found in fruit vegetables, potatoes pasta rice and legumes.
3. Make insulin levels increase in a slower way

If the body produces too much glucoses, it stores it in the liver and muscles as glycogen. Any leftover glycogen is stored as fat. 
Too few carbs cause fatigue, muscle cramps, and poor mental functions.
# Proteins
Large complex molecules that:
1. create body tissue
	1. Muscles bones hair and nails
2. Transport oxygen 
3. Carry the genetic code (to all cells)
The base unit of the protein is the amino acid:
1. Organic molecules made up of a carbon atom attached to:
	1. Hydrogen 
	2. amine group 
	3. acid group 
2. Theres 20 amino acids, 9 of witch (essential amminoacids) cant be synthesized and must be obtained from the diet. 
3. They form chains called polypeptides.
4. one or more polypeptides make a protein

Proteins are split in:
1. Antibodies 
	1. travel through the bloodstream and (are used by the immune system to) identify threats and eliminate them
2. Motor proteins 
	1.  responsible for muscle movment
	2. like actin and myosin
3. Enzymes/catalists
	1. speed up biochemical reactions
	2. like lactase and pepsin
4. Hormonal proteins 
	1. (messenger proteins that) coordinate bodily activities
	2. like insulin and oxytocin
5. Structural proteins 
	1. are fibrous and stringy
		1. provide support 
	2. like keratin, collagen and elastin 
6. Storage proteins 
	1. store amino acids for later use 
	2. like ovalbumin (found in egg whites) and casein (mik based)
7. Transport proteins 
	1. move molecules 
	2. like hemoglobin (moves oxygen)
# Lipids
Found in meat and dairy.
Nuts, seeds, soybeans, olives, peanuts and avocadoes contain the essential fatty acids.
>Most foods contain fat

Fat is necessary, but too much causes obesity, cardiovascular disease and forms of cancer.
Like carbs, lipids are made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
Theyre:
1. The most concentrated energy source 
2. Transport, absorb and digest vitamins A,D,E,K (called fat soluble)
3. protect vital organs 
4. regulate temperature change 
5. store energy 
6. are insoluble in water, but soluble in fat solvents 
7. Are split in:
	1. Saturated 
		1. (NOT NECESSARY) has 0 double bonds
		2. found in animals
		3. hard at room temperature 
		4. like lard, butter, coconut and peanut oil 
		5. go rancid less easily 
	2. Unsaturated 
		1. liquid at room temperature 
		2. sensitive to interactions with oxygen, light and heat 
			1. often kept in dark cans or glasses 
		3. Split in:
			1. monounsaturated 
				1. only one double bond
				2. like oleic acid, found in olive oil 
			2. polyunsaturated
				1. has multiple double bonds
				2. Like linoleic acaid, found in sunflower oil
# Vitamins 
Needed for growth and good health.
Except for vitamin D, cannot be synthesized by the body. 
There are 13 vitamins classified in 2 groups:
1. Fat soluble 
	1. Dissolve in fats
	2. stored in body fat
		1. especially the liver, where they are kept as reserves 
	3. Do not require daily consumption 
	4. are A,E,D,K
2. Water soluble 
	1. dissolve in water 
	2. cannot be stored 
	3. Require daily consumption 
	4. are C and the vitamin B complex (folic acid, pantothenic acid, biotin, cobalamin, niacin, riboflavin, pyridoxine and thiamine)
Avitaminosis is a shortage of vitamins. 
Each vitamin has a specific role (and its lack causes a specific illness, so lack of vitamin A causes metabolism malfunctions)
>A lack of vitamins can be caused by insufficient food (like in poor countries that do not reach the daily Reccomended dietary allowance) or a diet not varied enough 

During pregnancy or breastfeeding the body needs more vitamins (because the baby needs to get them from the mother.)

>- Old ppl are more at risk of not having enough vitamins.
>- Sailors often got scurvy bcs of a lack of vitamin C

# Minerals 
Found in the earth/food. needed for heart/brain functions and hormone production. 

divided in:
1. Macrominerals, needed in large amounts, like calcium and magnesium 
2. Trace minerals like iron and manganese.

Examples:
1. Antioxidants 
	1. prevent/delay cell damage, but no diseases
	2. like vitamins C or beta-carotene. 
	3. found in fruits and vegetables.
2. Calcium 
	1. stored in bones and teeth for strength
	2. Used to
		1.  help muscles and blood vessels contract/expand 
		2. send messages
		3. release hormones and enzymes 
3. Iron 
	1. part of hemoglobin.
	2. import for cell growth, development and body functions.
	3. helps make hormones and connective tissue. 
4. Magnesium 
	1. Regulates 
		1. muscle and nerve functions 
		2. blood sugar 
		3. blood pressure 
	2. Helps make protein, bone and DNA.

# Eating disorders 
They usually occurred around age 13-15, but victims have been getting younger.
>Young girls are more at risk 

Extremes in eating behaviour, that are serious mental illnesses.

They go hand in hand with (are caused or determine) stress, anxiety, depression and substance abouse, and suicidalityy.
%%Maybe delete later%%
They can cause heart or kidney problems, malnutrition or death.
# Anorexia (nervosa)
>10% of ppl are male
Victims have an extremely low body weight.
Split in:
1. Binge/Purge 
	1. The victim purges after eating, in order to alleviate the fear of putting on weight, or the guild of eating *forbidden foods*; they use :
		1. excessive exercise/fasting
		2. vomiting
		3. laxatives/diuretics/ enemas (liquid injected in the rectum)
		4. forced vomiting
2. Restrictive 
	1. self starvation, aka consuming less calories that needed for an healthy weight

Its caused by:
1. Irregular hormone functions 
2. the media/poor self esteem 
3. carrers that promote being thin, like ballet or modelling. 
4. Trauma 
5. peer pressure 
6. stress

Malnutrition can cause:
- Hair loss 
- period loss
- Brittle bones 
- swollen joints
- drop in blood pressure. 

# Bulimia (nervosa)
Binging (Ingestion of tons of food, up to 1000 calories), then an attempt to avoid gaining weight, by trying to purge. This is why many people have a normal weight.

>To be officially diagnosed they need to happen once a week for at least 3 months
There are 2 types:
1. Purging
	1. Most common 
	2. Use the same methods are purging anorexia (expect for fasting/excessive exercise)
2. Non purging 
	1. use excessive exercise/fasting

Its causes are: 
1. stress 
2. trauma 
3. poor self esteem 

Constant vomiting and lack of nutrients cause:

1. stomach pain
2. stomach/kidney damage
3. Heartburn 
4. Abdominal discomfort
5. tooth decay due to exposure to stomach acids 
6. Teeth sensitivity
7. Swelling of the parotid glands
8. Blood in vomit
9. Low electrolytes
10. Abnormal heart rythm
11. loss of potassium
	1. can cause heart problems and death.

Treatments 
1. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy 


1. Seeing the eating disorder as different form the loved one.
2. The longer someone has a disorder the lower the chance of recovery.

# Fiber 
Known as roughage, made up of the parts of plant foods the body cant digest.
Found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes.
Eating a lot of fiber can
1. Help maintain a healthy weight  
	1. High fiber foods are more fillings, take longer to eat and have less calories.
2. relieves constipation 
	1. increases stool size and softens it. Also helps if the stool is very watery
3. Helps maintain bowel weight 
	1. Lowers the risk of hemorroids and diverticular disease (small pouches in the colon). Also lowers the risk of colorectal cancer. 
	2. this is because some fiber is fermentedd in the colon.
4. lowers risk of heart disease and cancer 
5. lowers risk of type 2 diabetes
	1. by slowing the absorbsion of sugar and thus improving blood sugar levels
Split in:
1. soluble
	1. dissolves in water to form a gel-like material.
	2. Lowers cholesterol and glucose levels 
	3. found in oats, apples and citrus fruits 
2. insoluble 
	1. promotes the movment of material through the digestive system
	2. increases stool (shit) bulk. 
	3. Found in whole wheat, potatoes and nuts.

White grain does not contain any fiber, because it removes the outer coat (bran).

How to add more fiber:
- Choose high fiber cereal or add tablespoons of unprocessed wheat bran to your cereal 
- Consume at least half of all grains as whole greans. 
	- Get breads with at least 2 grams of dietary fiber per serving 
	- Try brown/fild rice, barley and whole wheat pasta
- When baking substitute half of white flower with whole grain.
	- Add oatmeal and bran to sweets 
- Eat 5 or more servings of fruit/vedgetables 
- Snack with fruits/vegetables, low-fat popcorn, nuts and whole grain crackers.

Too much fiber to quickly:
- promotes intestinal gas abdominal bloating and cramping
	- because the bacterias are not adjusted to the change 

Fiber works best when it absorbs water.
# Binge Eating
Disorder defined by chronic compulsive overeating (someone consumes a lot of food and feels unable to stop, aka eating fast/to the point of nausea/when not hungry, in secret, followed by feelings of guilt and loss of control). Most common eating disorder.

Individuals restrict their diet, followed by physiological pressures to eat, followed by binging followed by shame followed by restring the diet.
managed by:
1. Mindful eating 
	1. Ask yourself why youre eating and 
	2. Eat slower (20 min per meal)
	3. Sit at the table 
	4. Avoid distractions
2. dont eat if youre not hungry 
	1. Avoid emotional eating
	2. real hunger is characterized by feelings of emptiness and stomach grumblings
		1. It can cause headaches and light headedness
3. Stop eating when at 80%
4. Keep a journal 
5. Tackle your triggers
	1. triggers can be boredom, certain foods or places
	2. Remove or reduce the triggers impact.
	3. Plan your meals 
	4. remove trigger foods.
6. Normalize eating. 
Risk factors for developing are:
- Dieting
- Diabetes 
- Medications 
- Athletes who do not increase their calories during sport season 
- Yo-yo dieting 
- Stress
# Diet
Eatwell guide:
- 5 portions of fruits and vegetables  
	- 80 grams, or what you can fit into your hand.
	- For vedgetables like peas or sweetcorn a portion is 2-3 tablespoons
	- Fruit juice and smoothies should be no more then 150 mls a day
	- Dry fruits should be no more then 30 grams 
	- Try to avoid syrup bcs of its high sugar
- Starchy carbohidrates 
	- Eat at every meal (1/3 of the plate), because they are high in fiber and are the main source of energy
	- Keep the skin on potatoes 
- Dairy (except for cream/butter and eggs)
	- If going for alternatives go for the unsweetened ones fortified with calcium
	- Go for semi-skimmed or skimmed milk and low fat cheese.
	- 3 portions per day.
	- Grate your cheese to use less of it.
- Other proteins 
	- Sources of iron 
	- 2 portions or 3 if vegetarian. 
	- Choose as lean meat as possible 
	- choose less red and processed meat 
	- 2 portions of fish: one white and 1 oily.
- Oils 
	- Eat sparingly
- Not part of the guide  
	- High in saturated fats, salt or sugar. 
	- We dont need them for the diet
Too much salt increases blood pressure
